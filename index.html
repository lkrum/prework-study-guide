          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type it.</li>
          <li>The html opening tag represents the start of our HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>The Wild card symbol * is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>The block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li> 
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

          <li>git push: Creates a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch</li>
          <li>git pull: Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m: Commits your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
          <li>git pull origin [name]: pull command receives a branch's modifications into the local environment; the origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo; the main keyword indicates the branch.
