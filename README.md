# <Leah's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I created a prework study guide to store my programming notes in one singular location so that I could have a convenient resource to turn to when learning to code and for continuing education. My notes include basic coding and software definitions as well as specific coding commands pertaining to GitHub, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
